  "initial_scene_description": "The abandoned prison's crumbling facade looms over the German landscape as the sun sets behind it. Dust devils dance through the empty cells, and cobwebs cling to rusty bars.\n\nSaman, a young Iranian architect with a sharp jawline, surveys the site with his wife Leila, her dark hair tied back in a ponytail. Their company's logo, \"Persian Restoration\", is emblazoned on their truck parked nearby.\n\nThe air is heavy with foreboding as Saman measures the cells, his eyes squinting against the fading light. The silence between them is punctuated by the creak of wooden doors and the distant rumble of machinery.\n\nA chill runs down Leila's spine as she glances up at the prison's imposing walls, their graffiti-covered stone a testament to the stories they hold.",

She runs her hand over the rough surface, as if seeking hidden stories within the cracks. The wind stirs, rustling the dusty cobwebs, and she shivers.\n\nSaman gestures to a section of the wall where a fresco remains intact despite the decay around it. He measures the space with his arm, eyes squinting in concentration. Leila walks closer, her footsteps echoing off the walls as she inspects the artwork."
