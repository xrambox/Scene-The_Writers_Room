K\u00fcbra, a young Syrian woman with sunken eyes, huddles on a narrow bed, clutching a worn teddy bear. Esma, her mother, sits beside her, hands clasped together in prayer.\n\nThe air is heavy with the smell of stale bread and despair. Snowflakes dance outside, but inside, warmth is scarce. K\u00fcbra's eyes are fixed on a tattered Christmas tree, its branches bare except for a few flickering candles. Esma's gaze drifts to her daughter, her face etched with worry.",
