  "initial_scene_description": "The crumbling walls of Stalag IXA prison loomed like skeletal fingers over the deserted German landscape. Ahmad and Aida, hand in hand, walked through the dusty courtyard, their footsteps echoing off the cold stone.\n\nAhmad, a young Iranian engineer with a kind face, surveyed the dilapidated buildings as he led Aida to the central hub of the complex. His dark hair was flecked with dust from the renovation site.\n\nAida's bright smile faltered for a moment as she took in the bleak surroundings, her eyes lingering on the rusting barbed wire that once held prisoners captive. Her long brown hair whipped about her face as a gust of wind swept through.\n\nTogether, they approached a makeshift office trailer, a symbol of hope amidst the decay.",

The scent of mildew wafted through the air as Ahmad gestured for Aida to enter.\n\nShe slipped inside, her eyes adjusting to the dim light within. The trailer's metal walls seemed to close in around them, muffling the outside sounds of rain and wind."
