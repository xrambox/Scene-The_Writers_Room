Her dark hair is tied back, revealing a smudge of mortar on her cheek.\n\nThe camera pans across the ruin, capturing the remnants of once-cold cells and rusting bars. Leila's hand brushes against Ahmad's as they walk towards the main entrance.\n\nA flickering work light casts long shadows, illuminating the couple's determined expressions.",
