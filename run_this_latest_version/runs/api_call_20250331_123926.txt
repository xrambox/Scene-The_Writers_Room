  "initial_scene_description": "Snowflakes gently fall outside the makeshift walls of the refugee shelter in Berlin. Sahar, a young Muslim woman, sits alone on a cot, her eyes fixed on a small, worn-out Quran as she quietly prays. Her husband, Amir, enters with a steaming cup of coffee, his face weary from the day's struggles.\n\nA faint scent of cardamom and spices wafts through the air, mingling with the sterile smell of disinfectant and worn fabric. The shelter's makeshift Christmas decorations \u2013 a small tree made of twigs and some torn cloth garlands \u2013 seem out of place amidst the bleakness.\n\nAmir gently places the cup in front of Sahar, his eyes locking onto hers as he sits beside her. Their hands touch briefly, a fleeting spark of comfort in this desolate space.",
