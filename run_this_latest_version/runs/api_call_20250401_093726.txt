  "initial_scene_description": "A dimly lit refugee shelter in rural Germany. The Christmas tree's twinkling lights cast an eerie glow on the worn faces of its occupants. A young Muslim couple, Amira and Khaled, huddle together on a narrow bed, shivering beneath thin blankets. Outside, snowflakes dance in the faint moonlight, muffling the distant hum of German cars.\n\nAmira's eyes dart towards the small window, where frost has etched intricate patterns. Her hands absently cradle her swollen belly. Khaled's gaze is fixed on the worn Quran on his lap, its pages fluttering as he nervously flips through them.",

The Quran lies open on the floorboards, its pages fluttering with an otherworldly sigh. Amira's gaze lingers on the worn leather cover, etched with intricate calligraphy that seems to shimmer in the dim light.\n\nThe sound of Emil's footsteps echoes through the corridor, growing louder as he approaches their makeshift bed. His boots scrape against the cold floorboards, sending shivers down Amira's spine. She tugs the blanket tighter around her shoulders, her eyes never leaving the Quran."
